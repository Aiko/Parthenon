# Creating a Board

Easily manage emails by **tasks**, **departments**, **teams**, **client accounts** or **any list you want to create**. These boards allow for easy customization and optimal productivity. In this tutorial we will learn how to create one.

### Let's get started

**Click on the "+" button** to the right of your boards. In this example I will create a "Meetings" board.

This will open a window where you will pick a name for your board.

### Give it a name

This is where you choose what you want this board to be called, it could be **Travel**, **"Show John"**, **Calls**, **Prospecting** or anything **specific to your industry**. **Click on "Add"** when finished.

### All done

Your board is now created. You can **drag and drop emails into your newly created board** or you can automate the process by **[creating a board rule](/docs/tutorial-extras/creating-board-rules)**.

You can organise your boards by collapsing them, learn about **[collapsing boards](/docs/tutorial-extras/selecting-board-width)**.
