# Creating Board Rules

Board rules automatically sort your incoming emails into boards so you can **wake up to organized lists of emails and tasks**. In this tutorial we will learn how to create a board rule.

### Let's get started

**Click on the 3 dots icon** to the left of the inbox board.

![Click on add a board](/img/add-rule-1.png)

This will open options, just **click on "Board rules"**

![Enter a board name](/img/add-rule-2.png)

### Add a board rule

This window shows all your current board rules and allows you to create a new one. Click on **"Add a rule"**

### How it works

Board rules are as powerful as you make them. Some are AI-powered and some are simple conditional rules.

The **condition** can be **to, from, subject, scheduling, attachment, priority** and much more

The **value** is what you are looking for.

The **action** is what you want to happen if the condition is met.

The **target** is which board should emails matching your condition go to.



Click on **"Add"** when you are done.

In this example above, all emails coming from **ruben@aikomail.com** will go into my **Meetings board**.

Your board rule is now created. You can organise your boards by collapsing them, learn about **[collapsing boards](/docs/tutorial-extras/selecting-board-width)**.
